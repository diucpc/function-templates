# PROBLEM:
# The program takes both the values from the user
# and swaps them without using temporary variable

value1 = int(input("Enter value of first variable: "))
value2 = int(input("Enter value of second variable: "))

# swaping
value1 = value1 + value2
value2 = value1 - value2
value1 = value1 - value2

# Happy Coding ✌🏻
